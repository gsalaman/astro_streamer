# astro_streamer

## next improvements
* CHANGE PORT!!!
* add exif data to pictures
* split stream vs picture so that I can "click" 12mp updates
* "click" takes number that gives number of pics


# OLD:
Next experiments:
* can I take pics whilst doing the stream?  Start with 640x480  - yes!
* can I stream in 1080p with the HQ cam?  Its that the default? -yes, specify 1920x1080
* Dual streams:  split cam resolution vs stream resolution - can make webpage scale stream.

And then once I have pics, specify filename, delay, and number of pics to take...maybe a separate app to start?

# MQTT Interface
iso -done
rot - done
click - takes one pic

Add:
* optional # of pics
* time between pics
* filename - must be set for click?
* preview on/off
