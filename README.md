# astro_streamer

Next experiments:
* can I take pics whilst doing the stream?  Start with 640x480
* can I stream in 1080p with the HQ cam?  Its that the default?
* Dual streams:  split cam resolution vs stream resolution

And then once I have pics, specify filename, delay, and number of pics to take...maybe a separate app to start?
